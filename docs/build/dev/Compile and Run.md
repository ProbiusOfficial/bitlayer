# JSON-RPC API METHODS

Bitlayer provides all json-rpc api methods listed in [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#json-rpc-methods). 

Besides, it has several custom methods.

## eth_getTraceActionByTxHash
Returns logs of internal transactions by hash of a transaction.

### Parameters

1. DATA, 32 Bytes - hash of a transaction


2. Object - The filter options:
    - fromUser: DATA|Array, 20 Bytes - (optional) address of the sender.
    - toBlock: DATA|Array, 20 Bytes - (optional) address of the receiver.
    - opCode: String - (optional) An EVM opcode for a transaction's log.
    - minValue: QUANTITY|TAG - (optional) the minimal value or amount transferred in BRC.

### Returns

Object - A internal transaction's log object, or null when no log was found:

- transactionHash: DATA, 32 Bytes - hash of the transaction.
- blockHash: DATA, 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this transaction was in. null when its pending.
- blockNumber: QUANTITY - block number where this transaction was in.
- logs: Array - Array of log objects, which this transaction generated. The log object:
    - from: DATA, 20 Bytes - address of the sender. 
    - to: DATA, 20 Bytes - address of the receiver. null when it's a contract creation transaction. 
    - value: QUANTITY - value transferred in BRC. 
    - success: QUANTITY - a boolean value indicating whether the call was successfully completed. either 1 (success) or 0 (failure)
    - opcode: DATA - the EVM opcode of the transaction's log. 
    - depth: QUANTITY - the length of callstack in EVM. 
    - gas: QUANTITY - gas provided by the sender. 
    - gas_used: QUANTITY - The amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone. 
    - input: DATA - the data send along with the transaction. 
    - trace_address: QUANTITY|Array - Array of call trace where each element signifies the depth of a call during execution.
