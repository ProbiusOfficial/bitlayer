 - https://testnet-rpc.bitlayer.org: This RPC endpoint allows developers to send requests and interact with the Bitlayer testnet programmatically. It is commonly used for deploying contracts, querying blockchain data, and executing transactions.
 - wss://testnet-ws.bitlayer.org: This WebSocket endpoint enables real-time communication with the Bitlayer testnet. Developers can subscribe to events and receive updates as they occur on the network.

## Explorer
To explore and inspect transactions, blocks, and addresses on the Bitlayer testnet, you can utilize the following explorer:
- https://testnet-scan.bitlayer.org

## Faucet
For testing purposes, the Bitlayer testnet offers a faucet that dispenses test BTC tokens. The faucet provides a way for developers to obtain test tokens without the need for actual value. 

You can access the Bitlayer testnet faucet at:
- https://www.bitlayer.org/faucet: By visiting this URL, developers can request a certain amount (0.05 BTC) of test BTC tokens to use in their development and testing processes.

｜Chain ID｜200810｜
｜Currency symbol｜BTC｜
｜----｜----｜

After saving the network configuration, you should now have the Bitlayer Testnet selected!


### Faucet: Request testnet tokens on Bitlayer Testnet to power your first transactions
Bitlayer is an EVM-compatible blockchain, and can enable applications and developers from the existing Ethereum ecosystem to migrate to Bitlayer at low cost, eliminating the need for substantial modifications or rewrites.

If you want to interact with the Dapps on Bitlayer Testnet, your first stop is going to be to a “faucet” to fill up your “tank”. 

Here is a faucet directly distributes Bitlayer Testnet tokens: https://www.bitlayer.org/faucet

It may take a few seconds for them to appear, but you can check the status by looking for a transaction for your address in [Bitlayer Explorer](https://testnet-scan.bitlayer.org).


**Pace Yourself!**

**You can obtain Bitlayer Testnet tokens every 24 hours for development.**

**And the testnet token has no financial value and cannot be traded at a real price.**
